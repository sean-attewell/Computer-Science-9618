# The above with statement will automatically close the file after the nested block of code. 
# The advantage of using a with statement is that it is guaranteed to close the file no matter how the nested block exits. 
# If an exception occurs before the end of the block, it will close the file before the exception is caught by an outer exception handler. 
# If the nested block were to contain a return statement, or a continue or break statement, 
# the with statement would automatically close the file in those cases, too.
